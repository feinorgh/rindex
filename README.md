# rindex is a recursive image indexer

rindex attempts to be as fast and efficient as possible traversing
directories with many image files.

This is a very rough and very early sketch of a full application.

You need to give it a directory to work with as an argument. It will
recursively traverse this directory and write out any files with
extensions matching common image formats.
